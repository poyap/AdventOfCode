The method used in this ans.py is depth first search.Hence we used stack.
Also we could use breath first search, so we should use queue.

If we want to traverse using depth_first_search algorithm:
we can use: 1)stack
            2)Recursion
Also if we want to traverse using breadth_first_search algorithm we should approach using:
1) Queue
2) Recursion
